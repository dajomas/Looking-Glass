# HTTP API

All JSON endpoints need a session cookie. State-changing calls need the header
`X-CSRF-Token: <token>`; the token is in `<meta name="csrf-token">` on every
page. Errors look like `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`.

## Admin port (5000)

| Method | Path | Body | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/maps/{id}` | | Map info, calibration, walls (image coords), counts, live state |
| GET | `/api/maps/{id}/image` | | Raw battle map |
| GET | `/api/maps/{id}/fog.png` | | RGBA mask (alpha = revealed) at work resolution |
| GET | `/api/maps/{id}/viewer-preview` | | Exactly the image players receive |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/reveal` | `{"x":..,"y":..}` (image px) | Reveal the area at the point; returns `area_fraction`, `leak_warning` |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/hide` | `{"x":..,"y":..}` | Hide the area at the point |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/reveal-all` | | Reveal everything |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/reset` | | Fog everything (undoable) |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/undo` | | Undo the last fog operation |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/calibration` | `{"offset_x","offset_y","scale_x","scale_y","doors_block"}` | Wall alignment |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/walls/inspect` | multipart `file` | List scenes in a wall file |
| POST | `/api/maps/{id}/walls` | multipart `file`, `scene_index`, `use_scene_calibration` | Import / replace walls |
| DELETE | `/api/maps/{id}/walls` | | Remove walls |
| POST | `/api/campaigns/{id}/active` | `{"map_id": 3}` or `{"map_id": null}` | Show a map to players / blank the screen |

HTML form posts (redirect with `?ok=` / `?err=`) cover campaigns
(`/campaigns`, `/campaigns/{id}/update|delete|active`), viewers
(`/campaigns/{id}/viewers/add|create`, `/campaigns/{id}/viewers/{uid}/remove`),
maps (`/campaigns/{id}/maps`, `/maps/{id}/rename|move|image|delete`) and users
(`/users`, `/users/{id}/update|password|delete`, superadmin only).

## Reusable wall sources (admin port only)

All routes below require manage permission for the campaign or map, including
read-only source inspection. Writes require CSRF. Raw source bytes are never
returned; these routes are not registered on the viewer application.

| Method | Path | Body | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/campaigns/{id}/wall-sources` | none | `{"ok":true,"sources":[...]}` |
| POST | `/api/campaigns/{id}/wall-sources` | multipart `file` | Validate and save; `{"ok":true,"source":{...}}` |
| GET | `/api/maps/{map_id}/wall-sources/{source_id}` | none | Source summary and `scenes[]`, with map-specific suggested calibration |
| POST | `/api/maps/{map_id}/walls/from-source` | JSON below | Existing map payload plus `imported`, `scene`, and `source_id` |
| DELETE | `/api/campaigns/{id}/wall-sources/{source_id}` | none | `{"ok":true}`; does not remove map walls |

```json
{"source_id": 1, "scene_index": 0, "use_scene_calibration": true}
```

`source_id` and `scene_index` are required. Source IDs are positive; scene indices
are zero-based, non-negative, and must be in range. `use_scene_calibration`
defaults to true. Missing/invalid fields use FastAPI validation errors (422);
unknown or cross-campaign sources and out-of-range indices return 400. Campaign
and map authorization follows the existing access helpers.

Source summaries contain `id`, `filename`, `scene_count`, and `created_at`.
Scene entries contain `index`, `name`, `format`, `walls`, `doors`, `scene_width`,
`scene_height`, and `calibration` (`offset_x/y`, `scale_x/y`). Empty scenes are
filtered by the existing parser; indices refer to this returned list. Duplicate
scene names remain separate choices, distinguished by index.

Uploads obey `storage.max_upload_mb`. Identical bytes in the same campaign
return the same source and retain its original filename. Sources are immutable:
uploading changed bytes creates a new source. Source inspection and saving do
not modify map walls, fog, or calibration. Applying copies walls to the target
map only, invalidates its fog cache, and notifies viewers. Existing fog actions
are preserved and replayed against the new geometry.

The existing one-off `/walls/inspect` and `/walls` APIs remain compatible and
do not save their files automatically. The HTML map upload saves valid wall
sources; a multi-set upload waits for selection instead of choosing index 0.

## Viewer port (6000)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/c/{campaign}/state` | Active map name, size, version and versioned `image_url` (or `map: null`) |
| GET | `/api/c/{campaign}/image` | Fogged composite of the active map |
| WS | `/ws/c/{campaign}` | Pushes `{"type":"refresh","reason":...}`; send `ping` to keep alive |

Both ports also serve `GET /healthz`.

## Explicit map-display reveal policy

`POST /api/campaigns/{id}/active` now requires `fog_action` whenever `map_id`
is non-null:

```json
{"map_id": 3, "fog_action": "restore"}
```

Use `"reset"` to delete the target map's fog-operation history before activating
it. Missing policy returns 400; unsupported values return validation error 422.
`{"map_id": null}` blanks the screen without requiring a policy. The HTML form
endpoint `/campaigns/{id}/active` accepts the same `fog_action` values. Existing
API clients must be updated; there is intentionally no silent default.

The update is transactional: checkpoint the outgoing map, restore/reset the
target, bump its fog version, checkpoint it, then activate it. Existing campaign
ownership and CSRF checks still apply. Display reset is not undoable.

Admin map JSON adds `cache_token`, an opaque unique map-incarnation identifier.
Viewer state `version` is opaque; use the supplied `image_url` rather than
constructing one. Versioned viewer image requests reject an obsolete `v` with
400 so a URL for an old state cannot receive the current map. Viewer composites,
admin raw images and admin masks use `Cache-Control: no-store`.
